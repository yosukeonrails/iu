 	<h2>Biography</h2><br>
 	<p>
Lee Ji-eun (Korean: 이지은; born May 16, 1993), better known by her stage name IU (Korean: 아이유), is a South Korean singer, songwriter and actress. While still in middle school, IU auditioned for various talent agencies with ambitions of becoming a singer. She signed with LOEN Entertainment in 2007 as a trainee and began her music career at the age of 15 with her debut album, Lost and Found. Her follow-up albums, Growing Up and IU...IM, brought her mainstream success, but it was through "Good Day" (Korean: 좋은 날), the lead single from her 2010 album Real, that she achieved national stardom. "Good Day" spent five consecutive weeks at the top position of South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and holds the record for spending the most number of weeks at No. 1 along with Psy's "Gangnam Style".[2]

With the success of her 2011 albums, Real+ and Last Fantasy, IU established herself as a formidable force on the music charts of her native country and further cemented her girl next door image as Korea's "little sister".[3][4] 2011 also saw her first foray into song-writing with "Hold My Hand", which was written for the television series The Greatest Love. IU's third full-length album release, Modern Times (2013) showcased a more mature style that was a departure from her established girlish image, with several tracks reaching the top 10 positions on Gaon Digital Chart.[3] While her subsequent releases, including albums A Flower Bookmark and Chat-Shire, continued to deviate from the mainstream K-pop style, IU retained her dominance on music charts.[5][6][7] Chat-Shire marked the first time she is credited as the sole lyricist and producer of her own album.[8][9]

IU has released three studio albums and nine extended plays, scoring two number-one albums and fourteen number-one singles on the Gaon Music Charts. As one of the best-selling solo artists in the K-pop industry, which is dominated by boy and girl groups,[10] she has been included on Forbes magazine's annual Korea Power Celebrity 40 list since 2012, reaching a peak ranking of number three in 2012.[11] Billboard recognized IU as the all-time leader of its Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart with the most number-one songs and the artist who has held the number-one position for the most number of weeks.[12]

Aside from her music career, IU has also ventured into hosting radio and television shows, as well as acting. Following her supporting role in teen drama Dream High and minor appearances in several television series, IU starred in You're the Best, Lee Soon-shin, Pretty Man, and The Producers.

<h2>Early Life</h2><br>

  <p>After spending 10 months as a trainee, IU released "Lost Child" (Korean: 미아) as her first single. She performed the song live for the first time on the music program, M! Countdown, on September 18, 2008, making it her debut performance as a professional singer.[25] Regarding the performance, IU recalled the crowd had hurled insults at her and though she felt discouraged by it, she now considers it a beneficial experience.[26] "Lost Child" is the lead single from her debut extended play Lost and Found, which was released on September 24, 2008. For the album, IU was awarded the "Rookie of the Month" by South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in November 2008.[27] However, the album did not do well commercially. During an interview in 2011, IU said, "My first album failed, but I'm grateful for that. If I had become successful as soon as I made my debut, I wouldn't appreciate my staff members and the popularity that I'm enjoying now."[23]

On April 16, 2009, IU launched her first studio album, Growing Up, with the lead promotional single, "Boo". She began her album promotion the next day, performing "Boo" on KBS2's Music Bank.[28] The song was noted for its stark contrast in musical style to "Lost Child", which was described as a "heavy" and "dark" ballad compared to the 1980s "retro sound" of "Boo".[29][30] Deemed as a "strategic" transformation, the dance choreography, stage costume and hairstyle shown in live performances were used to emphasize her youthfulness and project a "cute" image.[29][31] Although it drew a favorable response from the public, IU, who was fifteen years old at the time, admitted that the image made her feel awkward.[31] The song was nominated as a number-one contender on the popular music program, Inkigayo. Along with several songs from Lost and Found, "You Know" (Korean: 있잖 아) was also featured in Growing Up; a new rock-style arrangement of the song was released as the follow-up single to "Boo".

Towards the end of 2009, IU released her second extended play, IU...IM. She began promoting its lead single, "Marshmallow" (Korean: 마쉬멜로우), on music programs across the three major television networks from November 13, 2009. The song was described as "saccharine" with a style that was a hybrid of the rock-and-roll of the 1960s and "French pop".[32] Recalling the performances, IU stated on a 2013 episode of Happy Together that she disliked having to wear the girlish costumes and hairstyle fashioned for the song promotions.[33] The performances were well-received and were once again labelled "cute", reminiscent of reviews for "Boo".[34]

In addition to her album releases in 2009, IU participated in her first soundtracks via two MBC television dramas, Strike Love (Korean: 2009 외인구단) and Queen Seondeok (Korean: 선덕여왕). She also collaborated with artists such as Mighty Mouth and The Three Views on their albums. As her popularity began to rise, IU made more frequent appearances on variety shows, performing on Star Golden Bell, Kim Jung-eun's Chocolate and You Hee-yeol's Sketchbook. Her acoustic covers of other artists' songs such as Girls' Generation's "Gee", Super Junior's "Sorry, Sorry", and Big Bang's "Lies" (Korean: 거짓말) featured in these live performances gained tremendous interest online.[35] In late 2009, she became a TV presenter for the first time, hosting a weekly music chart show on Gom TV,[36] while appearing as a fixed guest on multiple radio programs such as Kiss the Radio, Volume Up, MBC Standard FM's Starry Night and MBC FM4U's Best Friend Radio.[37][38]</p>
